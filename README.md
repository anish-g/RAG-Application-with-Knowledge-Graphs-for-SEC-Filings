# RAG Application with Knowledge Graphs for SEC Filings

This project is a replication of project from __"Knowledge Graphs for RAG"__ course by __DeepLearning.AI__.

### Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model integrated with Knowledge Graphs to enhance information retrieval and generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. It aims to leverage the power of Knowledge Graphs to provide a structured and enriched context for the RAG model, improving its performance in various NLP tasks.

### Key Features
- __RAG Model Integration:__ The project utilizes the Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to combine the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches for generating responses.
- __Knowledge Graphs:__ Incorporates Knowledge Graphs to provide structured context, improving the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses.
- __Enhanced Retrieval Mechanism:__ The use of Knowledge Graphs enhances the retrieval mechanism by providing additional context and relationships between entities.
